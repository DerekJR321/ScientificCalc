Created July 2019 as an MIT License modification
of Peter Dematt√©'s 2015 Scientific Calculator

I've converted the ES5 to ES6 and changed 
functions to reflect more modern Javascript.
These changes were made by hand and not by
software. I wanted to learn as I converted.
It took me quite a while but it works (hopefully)
